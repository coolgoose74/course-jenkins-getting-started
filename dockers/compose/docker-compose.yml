services:

  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11
    ports:
    - "jenkins:9080:8080"
      ## or - "9080:8080"  url: localhost:9080
    volumes:
    - ./jenkins_home_on_host:/var/jenkins_home
    # using a bind mount to the host `./jenkins_home` means I can easily peruse the jenkins_home files without needing to "get into the container"
    # a named volume is fine too - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
    # Use above name volume for jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home, if there is an issue with bind mount (./jenkins_home_on_host:/var/jenkins_home), then this 
    # is recommended (named mount) and is way more performant and few issue as you are not going to map underlying host file into docker container.

    restart: unless-stopped


  # I like docker-compose because I can easily spin up multiple apps like a test email server alongside jenkins! for testing email notifications from jenkins (later)
  mails:
    image: mailhog/mailhog
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
    - "8025:8025" # mailhog's web app (think test instance of gmail)
    # "127.0.0.1:1025:8025" # jenkins will use `mails:8025` to send emails, only map to host if you want to send files
    # "8025:7-8025"


## NOTES:
# Host port bindings are constrained to listening on 127.0.0.1
# - avoids external access to services
# - To open external access:
#   - Remove IP address constraint to open the flood gates
#   - Bind to another IP
